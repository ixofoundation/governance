"# ixo Mainnet Upgrade Proposal v0.20.0\n\nThis proposal is to perform a Mainnet chain upgrade to ixo-4 from v0.19.3 to v0.20.0 at block height 1254500, which is estimated to occur on **Fri, 17 Mar 2023 06:30:00 UTC.**\n\nHere is a handy way to keep track of the date/time.[https://www.mintscan.io/ixo/blocks/1254500](https://www.mintscan.io/ixo/blocks/1254500)\n\nBlock times have high variance, so please monitor the chain closely.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe proposed upgrade streamlines custom modules and upgrades dependencies.\n\nThis is a high-level summary of the upgrade:\n\n- Dependent versions upgraded to:\n  - cosmos-sdk v0.45.12\n - ibc-go v4.3.0\n - wasmd v0.30.0\n  - tendermint v0.34.24\n- Introduces new features and improvements to the custom ixo go-modules; specifically for IID, Entity, Token, and Claims. Project and Payment have been removed.\n\n## Upgrade Process\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt block height, the state machine stops producing new blocks. The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network. \n\nUpgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. Validators are advised to use Cosmovisor to swap the binaries automatically. Instructions to migrate to use Cosmovisor: [https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor)\n\nInstructions to prepare the v0.20.0 binary can be found at [https://github.com/ixofoundation/genesis/tree/main/ixo-4](https://github.com/ixofoundation/genesis/tree/ixo-4) and the chain release will be available at [https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-blockchain/releases/tag/v0.20.0](https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-blockchain/releases/tag/v0.20.0)\n\nTestnet release candidate is available at [https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-blockchain/releases/tag/v0.20.0-rc.1](https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-blockchain/releases/tag/v0.20.0-rc.1)\n\n## Impacts\n\nClient applications must upgrade to the latest version of [@ixo/impactxclient-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ixo/impactxclient-sdk).\n\n## Risks\n\nAlthough extensive testing and simulations have been performed, this upgrade could experience problems that are introduced by unknown bugs or errors not yet identified, or that appear in the context of a full network upgrade. If serious network problems are encountered, all validators must stop operating the network immediately. Core Contributors will coordinate through the `#validators`channel of the [ixo Network Discord](https://discord.com/channels/745033220596301995/860574536779694111).\n\n## Voting\nnBy voting YES on this proposal, you agree that the  ixo-4 upgrade from v0.19.3 to v0.20.0 should proceed.\n\nBy voting NO on this proposal, you disagree that the ixo-4 upgrade from v0.19.3 to v0.20.0 should proceed.\n\nBy voting NO WITH VETO, you disagree with the ixo-4 upgrade from v0.19.3 to v0.20.0 taking place, and additionally wish to see depositors penalized.\n\nBy voting ABSTAIN, you decline to give an opinion on the upgrade."
