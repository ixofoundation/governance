"# ixo Mainnet Upgrade Proposal v0.20.0\n\nThis proposal is to perform a Mainnet chain upgrade with the following changes:\n\n- Upgrade v0.19.3 to v0.20.0 at block height 1345000, which is estimated to occur on **Thu Mar 23 2023 09:54:40 UTC**.\n\n- Change the ixo chain-id from ixo-4 to ixo-5.\n\n- Start block height from 1.\n\nHere is a handy way to keep track of the date/time. [https://www.mintscan.io/ixo/blocks/1345000](https://www.mintscan.io/ixo/blocks/1345000)\n\nBlock times have high variance, so please monitor the chain closely.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe proposed upgrade streamlines custom modules and upgrades dependencies.\n\nThis is a high-level summary of the upgrade:\n\n- Dependent versions upgraded:\n\n    - cosmos-sdk v0.45.12\n\n    - ibc-go v4.3.0\n\n    - wasmd v0.30.0\n\n    - tendermint v0.34.24\n\n- Custom ixo go-modules enhanced:\n\n    - IID, Entity, Token, and Claims modules improved.\n\n    - Project and Payment modules removed.\n\n## Upgrade Process\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt block height, the state machine stops producing new blocks. The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nNB: IBC Relayers should upgrade their clients during this period.\n\nUpgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary.\n\nInstructions to prepare the v0.20.0 binary can be found at [https://github.com/ixofoundation/genesis/tree/main/ixo-5](https://github.com/ixofoundation/genesis/tree/ixo-5) and the chain release will be available at [https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-blockchain/releases/tag/v0.20.0](https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-blockchain/releases/tag/v0.20.0)\n\nTestnet release candidate is available at [https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-blockchain/releases/tag/v0.20.0-rc.4](https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-blockchain/releases/tag/v0.20.0-rc.4)\n\n## Impacts\n\nClient applications must upgrade to the latest version of [@ixo/impactxclient-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ixo/impactxclient-sdk).\n\n## Risks\n\nAlthough extensive testing and simulations have been performed, this upgrade could experience problems that are introduced by unknown bugs or errors not yet identified, or that appear in the context of a full network upgrade. If serious network problems are encountered, all validators must stop operating the network immediately. Core Contributors will coordinate through the `#validators` channel of the [ixo Discord](https://discord.com/channels/745033220596301995/860574536779694111).\n\n## Voting\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal, you agree to upgrading from v0.19.3 to v0.20.0 and changing the chain-id to ixo-5.\n\nBy voting NO on this proposal, you do not want the ixo-4 upgrade from v0.19.3 to v0.20.0 and the chain-id changing to ixo-5.\n\nBy voting NO WITH VETO, you disagree with the ixo-4 upgrade from v0.19.3 to v0.20.0 taking place and the chain-id changing to ixo-5, and additionally wish to see depositors penalized.\n\nBy voting ABSTAIN, you decline to give an opinion on the upgrade.\n\n
